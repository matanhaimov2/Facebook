1. Adding to the site user security check:

in the app.js file i createed a function - PrivateRoutes that checks if a user is "logged in" if not reroutes to login.

2. Creation of GlobalVeriables File

in assets/GlobalVeriable.js i added all the global veriable to use in all the project becuase if we would ever have to change somthing. we wont go through all the files and change it. for example the server ip 


3. Service Creation

In stead of make the asxios request to the back from the login component for example we created a file that would be responsable for all 
the , authtications. login, register, isExpried - important, sign out.

isExpird is responsbale of checking if the user is vaild - real and if someone hacked someone else. we will uses togther sessions in order to create it.


4. Adding Top Nav to some of the component not all of them

I used the same logic to create this. just like we created the private Routes. check what routes need a top nav and the css splits them into ratio of 10% 90%, 10% being the top nav, 90% being the pages


Notes:

when logging in user. we save in the localstorage / cookies his data. the data is build from a few important things. email, userId, sessionId.



HomeWork:

1. Create a serviec for register, and fix the register file accordingly.

2. Create the top nav with an otpion to sign out.

3. create in the authService a sign out function. when clicking on sign out apply it. think carefully whats sign out need to do (hint: something with the localstorage)

4. you can keep doing any thing you want but you currently cant transfer the email through different componetnts - you can right now but we will change things and then you will need to change everything so wait with that. do styling shit
